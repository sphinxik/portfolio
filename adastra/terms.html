                          No Special Damages; Attorneys’ Fees. In the event of any Dispute (s) between you and Company
                          in any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, (i) you acknowledge and agree that
                          you shall not be entitled to apply for or recover punitive, consequential, or special damages
                          of any kind, nor shall you be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs
                          filing fees, hotel, air, or travel fees, among others, and (ii) the Parties agree that each
                          shall bear 100% of its respective costs, expert fees, attorneys’ fees, and other
                          fees incurred in connection with this Agreement, notwithstanding any law to the contrary that
                          potentially entitles you to recover fees and costs from Company. To the extent
                          that an action is brought by a third party on behalf of you in contravention of the terms and
                          spirit of this Agreement, you hereby expressly waive any claim to any form

                          Liquidated Damages for Breach by You. You agree that, if you violate, breach, or threaten
                          to breach any of your obligations under this Agreement, including initiating
                          a chargeback or undertaking to receive a refund or rebate in contravention of the terms
                          of this Agreement, damages will be extremely difficult or impossible to establish,
                          ascertain or prove. Therefore, you knowingly and voluntarily agree that the limitations set
                          forth in Paragraph 10 shall constitute an accurate measure of damages sustained
                          by Company. You acknowledge and agree that the liquidated damages stipulated in this paragraph
                          are not grossly disproportionate to any damage that might reasonably
                          be expected to follow from such a breach by you. Company shall, in addition to its other
                          rights and remedies, also have the right to elect to apply for or to seek,
                          in arbitration, interim or non-monetary relief, specific performance, and/or injunctive relief
                          in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, any provisions of this
                          Agreement (without the posting of a bond or other security), and you acknowledge and agree
                          that such relief would be appropriate relief for any such breach and to prevent
                          further breaches.
